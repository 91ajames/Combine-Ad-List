# Combine-Ad-List
I had created this list sometime in 2020 for myself and recently going back to some old projects to see what is what that others may enjoy.

Its helpful for those that have pihole and or adguard on portable devices on the go.


What this contains exactly? List of domains being joined and extracted from duplicates. This is a rough sorted script thats a nice cleaned and tightied.

Links from github and some other places.

I'm not going to keep this updated due to self explanatory.

plz keep these files on the main root inside a folder called docker.

Only issues is github due to there url certification when viewing the list of domains for some reason in linux from not wanting to download.

101,102,103,117,206,212,303,305,401

Never had this issue in the past, if someone wants to lend a hand and fix it, be my guess. Will update!


Plain list of links will be downloaded and sorted under /docker/combine-host2
